# dd-status

Run dd and get some info on its status.

## Usage

To test run 
```
npm start bs=1M if=/dev/random of=/dev/null
```
or whatever bs settings you fancy.

Be careful the program expects the arguments in the order used in the previous example and does not currently support any other dd option
